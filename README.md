Fifa Ultimate Team Squad Generator
Right now this is a console only program (input and output in console) I would like to make it into a web app or a desktop application.

What it does now:
1.)
    Gets the position of the player given the name... I could return any FIFA statistic I would like, but I believe that this is the most important as of now.
     input = "name=Lee Nguyen"
     output = "Lee Nguyen	CAM"

2.)
    Prints out all the teams it can given the formaton and Nationality.
     input = "form=442" or 433 or 343, "Brazil"
     output gives you every single team that can be generated by a 442 formation and brazilian players, by ranking highest to lowest.
     
Todo:
Neatly display the teams with the players pictures and stats.
Run all formations given in FIFA against all the nationalities and find the highest rated squad.
Be able to generate the best squad given a statistic to focus on.
